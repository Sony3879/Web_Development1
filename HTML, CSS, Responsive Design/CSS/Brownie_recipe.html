        <h1>Best Fudgy Brownies</h1>
        <p>These brownies always turn out perfect :). This Recipe makes <strong>16</strong> Brownies</p>
        <h3>Why I love Brownies (and you should too!)</h3>
        <p>Here are just some of the reasons brownies fill our hearts with love: First, brownies are plain addictive.
            They‚Äôre so delicious. 
            The rich chocolate taste, along with the dense and creamy texture will keep you unwrapping one Brownie after another. 
            It isn‚Äôt too soft and fluffy like a chocolate cake, and it‚Äôs never tough and dry. 
            I like to load my brownies with chocolate and butter and great eggs so they remain deliciously seductive for many months.
            They‚Äôre versatile.   It doesn‚Äôt call for any special occasion to enjoy a brownie (or five). 
            Whether it‚Äôs your child‚Äôs birthday, a one fine weekend at home, Mother‚Äôs Day, Easter or a busy day in the office, you can enjoy this divine treat and call it a happy day.
            It is bursting in chocolate flavour. Most people love chocolates. Why wouldn‚Äôt they? 
            Chocolate in its own is absolutely delicious. Add in the eggs, butter, some sugar and other wonderful ingredients and you‚Äôd have something that is more divine.
