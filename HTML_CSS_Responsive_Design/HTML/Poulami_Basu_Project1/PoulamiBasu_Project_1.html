        <p>If you know me well, you know that I am obsessed with Harry Potter. 
            It’s one of the only series of books that has survived the many purges I’ve done on my stuff, 
            and it’s the only series of books that can continue to capture my heart even though I’ve read them countless times.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I re-read the series again this past year, I contemplated why I love the books so much. Is it the characters? 
            The writing? The escapism? The lessons I learn time and time again? All of the above? Here’s what I’ve come up with:
        </p>

                            <p>
                            Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone came out when I was 5 years old. I found the book in my school library when I was 9 amd from the very first chapter, 
                            I was totally captivated by the world of Harry and his friends. 
                            As each Harry Potter book came out after that, I found that I was able to grow and learn alongside Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 
                            Because I was growing up as they were growing up in the novels, I felt connected to them in a way I haven’t felt with any other characters in a story ever.
                            As the Harry Potter series ended, a chapter closed in my own life, but I was able to take so much of what I had learned from the books with me into the world.

                            <p>
                                Harry Potter has always allowed me to escape into a world that is mysterious and magical and so different from my own reality and I love that.
                                Since I read Harry Potter as an adolescent, I have revisited the books many times. Each time, I quickly lose myself in the world of magic; the story, the characters, and all the lessons to be learned.

                                Harry Potter also taught me how to use my imagination and believe in the impossible. 
                                If I can believe in a world where there are witches and wizards fighting an evil lord, 
                                and goblins guarding a bank that is built with an extravagant cart system guarding billions of wizard dollars, 
                                then why isn’t it possible for me to believe in myself and my dreams?

                            <p>
                                The real world is nothing like fighting Voldemort or dealing with Dementors, but sometimes life can feel really heavy. 
                                Harry Potter is a reminder to always be brave, always be courageous, and always stick to what you believe is right.
                                If there is anything that can be learned from this series of novels it is this: 
                                Harry never strays from what he believes is true or right, even if it means he might die. 
                                He stands up for himself, his friends, and his family. Always.

                                Harry, Ron, and Hermione never stray from one another. They have their moments, 
                                but at the end of the day, they always have each other’s backs. 
                                It’s hard to find a good friend that you can trust to always have your back.
                                For me, Harry Potter has taught me a lot about the kind of friend that I want to be to the people 
                                in my life, and what it truly means to be a good, reliable, trustworthy friend.

            Not only is Harry Potter one of the best fictional stories ever written, 
            but it’s a story that allows you to learn about yourself, and the world around around you. 
            It teaches you to look at the world differently, it encourages you to believe in magic, 
            it challenges you to believe in yourself, and to be brave during hard times. 
            Tthis is why I love Harry Potter and why I will continue to revisit the story time and time again.
